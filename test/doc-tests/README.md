Test CLI commands shown in the docs
===================================

This directory contains tests for all CLI commands currently shown in
https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/category/how-to-guides.

Ideally, the docs themselves would have executable tests on all of their CLI
examples. Perhaps in the future this can be facilitated by co-locating docs and
examples in the same repo with git submodules.
